## What this is

This repository contains the **on-chain execution contract** for WOWMAX on
Stellar: a Soroban contract that executes a pre-computed swap plan —
splits, multi-hop paths, and **cross-protocol** routes — **atomically in a
single transaction** across Stellar's Soroban DEX protocols.

The contract is a **plan executor**, not a router. Route selection (which
pools, which splits, in what proportion) is computed off-chain by the
WOWMAX pathfinder and handed to the contract as an explicit plan; the
contract executes exactly that plan and enforces end-to-end slippage. This
separation is deliberate: the contract holds no routing logic, so it can be
audited as a thin, predictable executor.

### What it does that a per-protocol aggregator cannot

The common Soroban aggregator pattern dispatches each leg of a split to a
single protocol (one protocol per path). This contract goes further:

- **Cross-protocol multi-hop in one call** — e.g. AQUA→USDC on Aquarius,
  then USDC→XLM on Soroswap, executed as one atomic `InvokeHostFunction`.
  The intermediate token is held by the contract between hops and fed
  forward by its actual balance.
- **Exact-pool targeting** — the plan names the precise pool for each leg
  (Aquarius `pool_index`, Soroswap pair, Phoenix pool), rather than
  delegating pool choice to a protocol's own router.
- **Atomic slippage on the summed output** — `amount_out_min` is enforced
  on the total across all split branches; any failing branch reverts the
  whole transaction.

## Supported venues

| Venue | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Soroswap | UniswapV2-style AMM (Soroban) | live |
| Aquarius | StableSwap / weighted AMM (Soroban) | live |
| Phoenix | XYK AMM (Soroban) | live |

Classic SDEX (Stellar's native order book) is **not** executed by this
contract — SDEX is path-payment-based, not a contract call, and is handled
in the classic execution path outside this repository. This contract covers
the three Soroban DEX protocols.

## Contract interface

The contract (crate `wowmax-stellar-router`, struct `WowmaxAggregator`)
exposes:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `swap(user, token_in, token_out, amount_in, amount_out_min, deadline, plan)` | **Main entry.** Executes a `Vec<Strand>` plan: parallel splits, each with sequential hops, across any mix of the three venues. Slippage enforced on the summed output. |
| `swap_soroswap(...)` | Single Soroswap swap along a path. |
| `swap_aqua(...)` | Single Aquarius `swap_chained` hop on a named pool. |
| `swap_phoenix(...)` | Single Phoenix pool swap. |
| `swap_aqua_then_soroswap(...)` | Cross-protocol two-leg helper (Aquarius → Soroswap). |

### Plan model

```
plan: Vec<Strand>
Strand { parts: u32, hops: Vec<Hop> }
Hop    { venue, pool, token_in, token_out, <venue-specific fields> }
```

The contract splits `amount_in` across strands by integer `parts`
(`strand_in = floor(amount_in * parts / total_parts)`, the last strand
taking the remainder), runs each strand's hops sequentially (each hop
consuming the previous hop's output), sums the strand outputs, checks
`amount_out_min`, and forwards the proceeds to `user`.

## Mainnet validation

All functions are validated on **Stellar mainnet** against live pools. See
[`docs/REPORT.md`](./docs/REPORT.md) for the full report and
[`docs/evidence/mainnet-tx.md`](./docs/evidence/mainnet-tx.md) for the
transaction list with explorer links.

Deployed contract (mainnet): see
[`public/mainnet.contracts.json`](./public/mainnet.contracts.json).

## Building

```bash
cd contracts
stellar contract build
```

Requires `stellar` CLI 26+ and the `wasm32v1-none` target. Produces
`contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/wowmax_stellar_router.wasm`.
